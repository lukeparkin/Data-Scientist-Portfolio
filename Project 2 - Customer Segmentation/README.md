# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Overview
This project performs an in-depth customer segmentation analysis using the [Mall Customers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python) from Kaggle. My goal in this project is to understand customer shopping behaviour by combining demographic information (Age, Gender & Annual Income) with spending patterns (Spending Score) to identify distinct behavioural segments.
Through feature engineering, manual segmentation and comparative analysis, this project unveils actionable insights for targeted marketing and customer strategy.

**Key Insights:**
- Younger customers (especially those in the category 18–35) have much higher average spending.
- No strong overall correlation between income and spending.
- "Young High-Spenders" are a small but very high-value group.
- "High Income / Low Spend" customers represent a clear upsell opportunity due to their low spending habits relative to income.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and EDA with Pandas and NumPy
- Feature engineering using binning
- Advanced groupby aggregations with custom calculations
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Business interpretation from data insights

## Data Source
- Mall Customers Dataset - Found [HERE](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Put Mall_Customers.csv in the project directory.
3. Run the notebook `Customer_Segmentation_Project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
4. All visualisations and results will be generated.

## Business Recommendations
1. Prioritise marketing efforts toward customers under 36, particularly the "Young High-Spenders" category.
2. Launch targeted upselling campaigns for high-income customers with low spending behaviour.
3. Develop age-specific product recommendations and promotions.
4. Implement personalised loyalty programs tailored to spending pattern.
